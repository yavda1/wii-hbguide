# Running the Exploit

#### Requirements
- An SD card that is formatted to FAT32
- A Wii on System Menu version 4.3

!> If your SD card is larger than 32GB, you will require third-party software like GUI format to format it to FAT32.

1. Access the Wii settings. Look for the system menu version and region in the top right corner. If it doesn't display "4.3," proceed with a Wii system update.
2. Choose `Internet` and then select `Console Information`.

?> Do not share your mac address with anyone. Only the website to launch the exploit.

3. Open a web browser on your PC and go to the [Letterbomb Website](https://please.hackmii.com). Select the appropriate system menu region for your Wii.
4. Once you've chosen your system menu code, enter your Wii's MAC address.
5. Tick the box that says `Bundle the HackMii Installer for me!` Then, cut either wire as instructed.
6. This will download a file called `Letterbomb.zip`. Extract its contents on your PC, and then connect your SD card (formatted to FAT32) to your computer.
7. Copy the "Private" folder and the `boot.elf` file from the extracted files. You can disregard the text files.

?> If you already have a `Private` folder on your SD card, it probably contains your existing save file backups. In this case, it's recommended to back it up to a computer temporarily.

8. Safely eject the SD card from your PC and insert it into the Wii. Keep in mind that you should expect to see a red envelope either a few days before, on the same day, or a few days after this step. When the red envelope appears, click on it to boot into the Hackmii Installer.
