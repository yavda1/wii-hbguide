# SaveGame Manager GX

SaveGame Manager GX is an homebrew app that lets you export, extract and install save files from or to your Wii.

!> The application may not work if you haven't installed [cIOS](https://wii.skyybrew.xyz/#/cIOS)

## Let's now install this software.

### You will need:
 
 - An SD card formatted FAT32

 - A working system

### How to run it

1. Download [SaveGame Manager GX](https://static.wiidatabase.de/SaveGame-Manager-GX-Beta.zip)
2. Extract the files on the root of your SD card.
3. Open the Homebrew Channel and run SaveGame Manager GX.

It should all work correctly. Let's see what can we do with it.

### Installing save files

1. Place your save files on the ```savegames``` folder on the root of your SD/USB (create one if you don't have it)
2. Open SaveGame Manager GX.
3. Identify the save file, then click on it.
4. Press install.

!> To install a save file, you need another one that is already on your Wii.

### Exporting save files

1. Identify and click the save file.
2. Either click copy or move, depending on what you want to do.

?> SaveGame Manager lets you copy over save files with copy protection (that normally can't be copied nor moved).

!> If the install button doesn't show up, you either don't have a save file of the same game on the Wii or it might be a cIOS related problem.
